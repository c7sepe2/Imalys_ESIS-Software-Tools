# Imalys Documents

The *Imalys* software library is documented in three forms:

- a [tutorial](tutorial/README.md) that includes images, binaries, examples and hints how to use *Imalys*

- a [manual](manual/Index.md) with precise descriptions of all *Imalys* commands and parameters

- [background](background/README.md) material explaining algorithms and concepts

Unfortunately the entire tutorial is too large to be stored at GitHub. Explanations and definitions  are stored locally, the complete tutorial is available at [Zenodo]().
