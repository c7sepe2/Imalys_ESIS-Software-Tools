### Imalys Documents

The *Imalys* software library is documented in two forms

- a tutorial that includes images, binaries, examples and hints how to use them

- an [introduction](0_Manual.md) to Imalys, definitions for all commands and parameters and background material explaining algorithms and concepts

Unfortunately the entire tutorial is too large to be stored at GitHub. Explanations and definitions  are stored locally, the complete tutorial is available at [Zenodo]().
