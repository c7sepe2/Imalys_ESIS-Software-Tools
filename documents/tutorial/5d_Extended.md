### T5d	Extended object features

The spectral differentiation of natural areas becomes more reliable when images from different **seasons** are used together. Equal seasons may originate from different years. A logical combination of very different parameters, including the color, shape, distribution and development of surface characteristics, may provide a robust alternative to machine learning without extensive training (Banzhaf 2018).

A purely statistical object classification without any training ([mapping]()) was sufficient to separate roof surfaces, streets, parks, small gardens and other elements from two very different images of the city of Leipzig. [T5b] shows the result for an **satellite image**, [T5c] the result for an **areal image** combined with an elevation model. In both cases identical process parameters were selected.

Due to this statistical base the method generates definitions for objects that are common in one image. Other landscapes or a different light invalidate the definitions. The technology has the advantage that it does not require any training or prior information. The result is only determined by the image data. It has the disadvantage that the results can only be transferred into images with the same structure. The technical implementation is described in detail under the “Methods” section.
