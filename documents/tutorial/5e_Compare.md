### T5e	Comparison, Class Reference

It is not easy to determine a temporal, spatial or combined spatio-temporal linking of images and other measurements. ESIS offers the command [rank], which allows any measurement series to be compared using a rank correlation. For this purpose, the time of the data acquisition or the location (preferably both) must be known in both datasets. 

[Compare]() returns two cross reference tables between the most recent classification result an a reference given as raster image or as polygons.

[Rank]() works with each distribution and can therefore analyze any pattern. As an alternative, the degree of correlation can be estimated according to X² [ChiSquare](). Strictly speaking, X² presupposes standard distribution, but can then be more selective.
